# If `/api/preview?slug` URLs don't have a `secret` search parameter then static rendering will still be optimistically enabled but without
# a `token` set. Instead, it'll check if the user have a valid Sanity session and have access to the project and dataset before any draft content is queried.
# You can turn this off by setting this env var to "true" and only valid secrets will be allowed to bypass static rendering and harden the security.
